Project Reponses:

- This gem takes advantage of Ruby's metaprogramming capabilities by dynamically and automatically creating methods to color text, rather than writing a static method for each color choice.

- Spent roughly 3 hours.

- Using the send method to create dynamic methods (and getting it to work properly) was the most rewarding challenge.

- However, much more growth to increase level of comfort dynamically creating metaprograms within Ruby.
